Hello there! I am currently a fifth year graduate student in theoretical chemistry under the supervision of 
[Joseph Subotnik](http://subotnikgroup.chem.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania. 

Here is how to pronounce my name : Xuezhi Bian (边学志).

My current research interest focus on non-adiabatic dynamics and spin chemistry, 
feel free to check out my [research projects](/projects/) and [publications](/publications/) for more details!

I expect to defend my dissertation in summer 2024 and I will join [Princeton](https://ccsc.princeton.edu/) as a postdoc. 

Excited to keep learning and exploring!
