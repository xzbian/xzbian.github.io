    abstract = {We show that standard Ehrenfest dynamics does not conserve linear and angular momentum when using a basis of truncated adiabatic states. However, we also show that previously proposed effective Ehrenfest equations of motion [M. Amano and K. Takatsuka, “Quantum fluctuation of electronic wave-packet dynamics coupled with classical nuclear motions,” J. Chem. Phys. 122, 084113 (2005) and V. Krishna, “Path integral formulation for quantum nonadiabatic dynamics and the mixed quantum classical limit,” J. Chem. Phys. 126, 134107 (2007)] involving the non-Abelian Berry force do maintain momentum conservation. As a numerical example, we investigate the Kramers doublet of the methoxy radical using generalized Hartree–Fock with spin–orbit coupling and confirm that angular momentum is conserved with the proper equations of motion. Our work makes clear some of the limitations of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation when using ab initio electronic structure theory to treat systems with unpaired electronic spin degrees of freedom, and we demonstrate that Ehrenfest dynamics can offer much improved, qualitatively correct results.},

    abstract = "{Modern electronic structure theory is built around the Born–Oppenheimer approximation and the construction of an electronic Hamiltonian Ĥel(X) that depends on the nuclear position X (and not the nuclear momentum P). In this article, using the well-known theory of electron translation (Γ′) and rotational (Γ″) factors to couple electronic transitions to nuclear motion, we construct a practical phase-space electronic Hamiltonian that depends on both nuclear position and momentum, ĤPS(X,P). While classical Born–Oppenheimer dynamics that run along the eigensurfaces of the operator Ĥel(X) can recover many nuclear properties correctly, we present some evidence that motion along the eigensurfaces of ĤPS(X,P) can better capture both nuclear and electronic properties (including the elusive electronic momentum studied by Nafie). Moreover, only the latter (as opposed to the former) conserves the total linear and angular momentum in general.}",

    abstract = "{Within the context of fewest-switch surface hopping (FSSH) dynamics, one often wishes to remove the angular component of the derivative coupling between states J and K. In a previous set of papers, Shu et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11, 1135–1140 (2020)] posited one approach for such a removal based on direct projection, while we isolated a second approach by constructing and differentiating a rotationally invariant basis. Unfortunately, neither approach was able to demonstrate a one-electron operator Ô whose matrix element JÔK was the angular component of the derivative coupling. Here, we show that a one-electron operator can, in fact, be constructed efficiently in a semi-local fashion. The present results yield physical insight into designing new surface hopping algorithms and are of immediate use for FSSH calculations.}",
